# CamAlert

For executing this application and its own environment you will need Docker and Docker Compose. Install it from here: https://www.docker.com

### First Step

Clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/IvanBuccella/CamAlert
```

### Second Step

Edit .env file COMPUTER_IP variable with your computer IP address.

### Third Step

Deploy local environment with Docker (since next time, the "--build" flag is unnecessary):

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build
```

### Enjoy :-)
